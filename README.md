# jekyll

This branch contains the template for the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site.

## Connection to `content` branch

This branch has a _special connection_ to the content branch. Namely, as soon as the [`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) file changes, it will automatically be mirrored to the `content` branch.
